INSTALLATION STEPS

To add internsctl as a built-in command in Linux, you typically need to place it in one of the directories listed in the PATH environment variable. Here are step-by-step instructions:

Choose a Directory:
Decide where you want to place the internsctl executable. Common choices include /usr/local/bin or /usr/bin. Make sure that the chosen directory is included in the system's PATH.

Copy internsctl to the Chosen Directory:
Assuming your internsctl script is named internsctl:

bash
Copy code to terminal
sudo cp internsctl /usr/local/bin
This command copies the internsctl script to /usr/local/bin and makes it available system-wide.

Set Permissions:
Ensure that the copied script has execute permissions:

bash
Copy code to terminal
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/internsctl
This command grants execute permissions to all users.

Verify Installation:
Open a new terminal window and run:

bash
Copy code to terminal
internsctl --version
It should display the version of internsctl, indicating that the command is now available.

(Optional) Remove Local Copies:
If you had a local copy of internsctl in the directory where you were working, you can remove it to avoid confusion:

bash
Copy code to terminal
rm internsctl
Now, internsctl should be accessible as a built-in command system-wide. Users can use it from any directory without specifying the path.

Keep in mind that modifying system-wide directories and files may require administrator (root) privileges (sudo).

Note: If you want to distribute internsctl as part of a package, consider creating a package for your Linux distribution (e.g., DEB for Debian/Ubuntu, RPM for Red Hat/Fedora) to facilitate installation, updates, and removal.


MANUAL ADDING STEPS

To add a manual page for internsctl using the display_manual function, you can create a manual page in the appropriate system directory. Here are the steps:

Create the Manual Page Content:
The display_manual function contains the content of the manual page. You can redirect this content to a file. Let's assume the manual page is stored in a file named internsctl.1:

bash
Copy code to terminal
./internsctl --help > internsctl.1
Move the Manual Page to the Appropriate Directory:
You should move the manual page file to the system directory where manual pages are stored. Common choices are /usr/share/man/man1/ or /usr/local/share/man/man1/. Use sudo to gain the necessary privileges:

bash
Copy code to terminal
sudo cp internsctl.1 /usr/share/man/man1/
If you encounter permission issues, adjust the command accordingly.

Update the Manual Page Database:
After moving the manual page, update the manual page database. This step might vary depending on your Linux distribution. For many systems, you can use the mandb command:

bash
Copy code to terminal
sudo mandb

Verify the Manual Page:
You can now view the manual page using the man command. For example:

bash
Copy code to terminal
man internsctl
This should display the manual page for internsctl containing the information from the display_manual function.

Now, users can access the manual page using the standard man command. Make sure to update the manual page whenever you make significant changes to the display_manual function or the command itself.
